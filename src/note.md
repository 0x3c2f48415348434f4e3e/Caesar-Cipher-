# File System
1. This will be an implementation of the file system. It will be based on classes, e.g.


File -> Several attributes includes:
1. File Name
2. File size
3. File location
Add more

Directory -> several attributes includes:
1. Directory Name
2. Directory location
Note 1 directory can have more than 1 file, so we will have inheritance here
Add more later
